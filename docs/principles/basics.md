# Basics

Accessibility is a criterion used to make sure any piece of technology, from an elevator to a phone or a website, is usable for as many people as possible. According to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), accessibility “means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can: perceive, understand, navigate, interact with the Web and contribute to the Web.”

## POUR principle

1. **Perceivable**: Web content is made available to the senses - sight, hearing, and/or touch.

2. **Operable**: Interface forms, controls, and navigation are operable.

3. **Understandable**: Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.

4. **Robust**: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
