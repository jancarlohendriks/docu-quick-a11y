# Regulations

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide an international set of guidelines. They are developed by the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C), the governing body of the web.

WCAG 2.0 was released nearly 10 years ago, and contains 12 guidelines for digital accessibility, divided
among four principles with the acronym P.O.U.R: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and
Robust. Each guideline has a list of “success criteria,” or requirements (61 in total), for making
content – including text, images, sounds, code and mark-up – more accessible.

In addition, WCAG 2.0 has three levels of conformance: **A** (minimum accessibility), **AA** (addresses the major, most common accessibility issues) and **AAA** (the highest standard).

The success criteria found in WCAG 2.0 are included in WCAG 2.1.

What’s new about WCAG 2.1 is that it includes 17 new success criteria related to mobile
accessibility, as well as provisions that will benefit more people.
